# Final-Project: Analysis of the Evolution of Comorbidity Networks over 1997-2014

## Author: Yijia Sun

## Disclaimer
This project was submitted for STATS201 Machine Learning for Social Science, instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University in Autumn 2025.

## Acknowledgments
We sincerely thank:
- **Prof. Luyao Zhang** for her guidance and insightful feedback throughout the project.
- **Our classmates** for their discussions and constructive critiques.
- **AIGC tools** such as ChatGPT and Storm for assisting in literature synthesis and data visualization.
- **Open-source communities** including Python, Matplotlib, etc. for providing essential machine learning and network analysis libraries.

## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth
Through this project, I deepened the understanding of **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** and its applications in public health. I gained hands-on experience in **data preprocessing, network construction, and machine learning techniques**, reinforcing our ability to analyze large-scale health datasets. The project also enhanced my **critical thinking and problem-solving** skills, equipping me for future research in data science and healthcare analytics.
